Git Pull / Pull Request


The term pull is used to receive data from GitHub.
 It fetches and merges changes from the remote server to your working directory. 
The git pull command is used to pull a repository.

Pull request is a process for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. 
Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their remote server account.
Pull request announces all the team members that they need to review the code and merge it into the 
master branch.

git conflict


Git can handle most merges on its own with automatic merging features. 
A conflict arises when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file,
 or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.
 Conflicts will most likely happen when working in a team environment.

What are merge conflicts in Git?


Image result for what is git conflict
A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve 
differences in code between two commits. Git can merge the changes automatically only 
if the commits are on different lines or branches. ... To prevent such conflicts, 
developers work in separate isolated branches.
